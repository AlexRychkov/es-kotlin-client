            ## Example
            
            This example is a bit more complicated than a typical hello world but more instructive 
            than just putting some objects in a schema less index. Which of course is something you should not do. The idea here
            is to touch on most topics a software engineer would need to deal with when creating a new project using Elasticsearch:
            
            - figuring out how to create an index and define a mapping
            - populating the index with content using the bulk API
            - querying data

            ## Co-routines
            
            Using co-routines is easy in Kotlin. Mostly things work almost the same way. Except everything is non blocking
            and asynchronous, which is nice. In other languages this creates all sorts of complications that Kotlin largely avoids.
            
            The Java client in Elasticsearch has support for non blocking IO. We leverage this to add our own suspending
            calls using extension functions via our gradle code generation plugin. This runs as part of the build process for this
             library so there should be no need for you to use  this plugin. 

            The added functions have the same signatures as their blocking variants. Except of course they have the 
            word async in their names and the suspend keyword in front of them. 
            
            We added suspending versions of the `Repository` and `BulkSession` as well, so either blocking or non
            blocking. It's up to you.
