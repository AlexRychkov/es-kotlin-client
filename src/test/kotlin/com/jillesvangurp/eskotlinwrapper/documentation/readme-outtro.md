## Code generation

This library makes use of code generated by our 
[code generation gradle plugin](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-codegen-plugin). This is mainly 
used to generate co-routine friendly suspendable extension functions for all asynchronous methods in the 
RestHighLevelClient. We may add more features in the future.

## Platform support & compatibility

This client requires Java 8 or higher (same JVM requirements as Elasticsearch). Some of the Kotlin functionality 
is also usable by Java developers (with some restrictions). However, you will probably want to use this from Kotlin.
Android is currently not supported as the minimum requirements for Elastic's highlevel client are Java 8. Besides, embedding
a fat library like that on Android is probably a bad idea and you should probably not be talking to Elasticsearch 
directly from a mobile phone in any case.

This library is tested with Elasticsearch 7.x. Usually we update to the latest version within days after 
Elasticsearch releases. Barring REST API changes, most of this client should work with any recent 7.x releases, 
any future releases and probably also 6.x.

For version 6.x, check the es-6.7.x branch.
 
## Building & Development

You need java >= 8 and docker + docker compose to run elasticsearch and the tests.

Simply use the gradle wrapper to build things:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Look inside the build file for comments and documentation.

If you create a pull request, please also regenerate the documentation with `build.sh` script. It regenerates 
the documentation. We host and version the documentation in this repository along with the source code.

Gradle will spin up Elasticsearch using the docker compose plugin for gradle and then run the tests against that. 
If you want to run the tests from your IDE, just use `docker-compose up -d` to start ES. The tests expect to find 
that on a non standard port of `9999`. This is to avoid accidentally running tests against a real cluster and making 
a mess there (I learned that lesson a long time ago).

## Development

This library should be perfectly fine for general use at this point. We released 1.0 beginning of 2021 an 
the plan is to continue to add functionality and continue to maintain this.
 
If you want to contribute, please file tickets, create PRs, etc. For bigger work, please communicate before hand 
before committing a lot of your time. I'm just inventing this as I go. Let me know what you think.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE). This maximizes everybody's freedom to do what needs doing. 
Please exercise your rights under this license in any way you feel is appropriate. Forking is allowed and encouraged. 
I do appreciate attribution and pull requests ...

Note, as of version 7.11.0, the Elastic Rest High Level Client that this library depends on has moved to a 
non oss license. Before that, it was licensed under a mix of Apache 2.0 and Elastic's proprietary licensing. 

As far as I understand it, that should not change anything for using this library which will continue 
to be licensed under the MIT license. But if that matters to you, you may want to stick with version 
1.0.12 of this library. Version 1.1.0 and onwards are going to continue to track the main line Elasticsearch.

## Support & Consultancy

For small things, use the issue tracker; I generally try to be helpful and try to resolve valid 
issues quickly. However, I'm also available for 
consultancy and specialize in a few things, including of course Elasticsearch. I've supported small
and large companies with search related product features, complex migrations, query optimizations, plugin
development, and more. I have over 15 years of experience with Lucene, Solr, and of course Elasticsearch. So,
if you need help with your Elastic setup, want to improve your queries or ingest architecture, or 
otherwise could use a second pair of eyes, please reach out.
